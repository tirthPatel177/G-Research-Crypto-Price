## Introduction
Crypto currencies have been a major trading market with over 40 billion$ worth of crypto-currencies being traded every day. However, one of the major issues is with its volatility. Here, we have attempted to mitigate the volatility by answering a question that is it possible to forecast short-term returns for various types of crypto-currency with an acceptable accuracy using classic machine learning algorithms. We used 2 different Machine Learning approaches to achieve this: Statistical method called ARIMA and Ensemble learning method called LGBM. Dataset is taken from an ongoing competition on Kaggle. Dataset contains crypto-trading data from 2018-2021 for 14 different crypto-currencies. We performed EDA on dataset, applied several versions of Regression which first lead us to ARIMA and subsequently to LGBM, and tuned hyper parameters to achieve the best possible results.
## Results
For different algorithms, results are shown below in a graphical format. For detailed reading and analysis, please refer to the report [here](https://github.com/tirthPatel177/G-Research-Crypto-Price/blob/main/report/5_Pied_Pipers_Mid_Sem_Project_Report.pdf).
